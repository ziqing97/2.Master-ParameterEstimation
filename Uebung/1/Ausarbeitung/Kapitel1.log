! Undefined control sequence.
l.1 \chapter
            {Ausarbeitung}
The control sequence at the end of the top line
of your error message was never \def'ed. If you have
misspelled it (e.g., `\hobx'), type `I' and the correct
spelling (e.g., `I\hbox'). Otherwise just continue,
and I'll forget about whatever was undefined.

really didn't forget anything, try typing `2' now; then
my insertion and my current dilemma will both disappear.
